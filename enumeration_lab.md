# Enumeration Lab

## Task
You have been given a test suite and two classes in the start point. 

Your job is to remove the `skip`s in the tests in `specs/star_system_spec.rb` one by one, and get each test to pass.

We would like you to use the enumeration methods we saw in the last lesson, as well as some that we didn't. Don't forget you can go to the Ruby docs and use Google effectively to find the appropriate enumerator methods if they weren't covered in the previous lesson.

> NOTE: You do **not** need to touch the `planet.rb` file, everything needed is already in there. Ensure any code you are writing is in the `star_system.rb` file.

## Remember
All of these tasks can be completed using the `.each` method. If you find these enumerators quite tricky, it is recommended that you begin by writing the task solutions using `.each` - and then revisit them if you have time afterwards.

Also **please** remember to take the time to *carefully* read each test to interpret what is required of each function.
